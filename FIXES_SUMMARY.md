# Markdown to PDF Converter Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to the Markdown to PDF Converter application to address the issues with PDF export and settings panel functionality.

## Issues Fixed

1. **PDF Export Not Working**
   - Fixed the LaTeX template to include the `\begin{document}` command

2. **Settings Panel Changes Not Reflected**
   - Fixed settings structure inconsistency by handling both "paragraph" and "paragraphs" settings
   - Added fallback values for all settings to handle missing or inconsistent settings
   - Used the .get() method to safely access settings that might not exist

3. **Testing Framework Improvements**
   - Created a comprehensive unit testing framework
   - Added timeout handling to prevent tests from hanging
   - Added process management to kill any hanging processes
   - Added better error handling and reporting

## Files Modified
